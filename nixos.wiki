### Nix os install not minimal

Nix os has a minimal install but i did not see any good usecase to use that minimal install so i just downloaded gnome or kde based install

- Download nixos from Download page
- I tried to daily drive nix os but i have gtk problems in standalone window managers, Now I decided to give it a some time in virtaul machine and then move eventualy tofull blown nix os
